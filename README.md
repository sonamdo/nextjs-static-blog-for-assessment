A NextJS quick and simple blog for an assessment

Take home test with a soft time limit of 2 hours

Spent about an hour and a half on this, would have worked on styling and post creation otherwise.

posts are found in the posts/ folder and rendered statically at build time

App initiated with create-next-app and installing react-markdown, not much else

To run the development server, use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

for production

```
npm run build
```
